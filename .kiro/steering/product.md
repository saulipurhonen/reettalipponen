# Product Overview

This is the personal portfolio website for Reetta Lipponen, a Finnish visual artist based in Lappeenranta. The site showcases her artwork (ceramics, installations, sculptures, customer work), CV, artist statement, and contact information.

The content is primarily in Finnish.

There are two versions of the site in this repo:

- **v1 (root `/`)**: Legacy Gatsby-based site with static image assets. No longer actively developed.
- **v2 (`/v2`)**: Active SvelteKit-based rebuild. Content is sourced from Contentful CMS. This is the current development target.

All new work should happen in the `v2/` directory unless explicitly stated otherwise.
