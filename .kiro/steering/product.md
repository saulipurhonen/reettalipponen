# Product Overview

This is the personal portfolio website for Reetta Lipponen, a Finnish visual artist based in Lappeenranta. The site showcases her artwork (ceramics, installations, sculptures, customer work), CV, artist statement, and contact information.

The content is primarily in Finnish.

There are three versions of the site in this repo:

- **v3 (`/v3`)**: Live Astro-based site. Content is managed via TinaCMS (Git-backed markdown). Deployed to GitHub Pages at `reettalipponen.art`. This is the current development target.
- **v2 (`/v2`)**: Previous SvelteKit-based version. Content sourced from Contentful CMS. No longer actively developed.
- **v1 (root `/`)**: Legacy Gatsby-based site with static image assets. No longer actively developed.

All new work should happen in the `v3/` directory unless explicitly stated otherwise.
